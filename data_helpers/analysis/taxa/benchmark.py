"""Shared broad-group rules and the GBIF described-diversity benchmark.

Broad groups are consumed from the per-taxon hierarchy assignments created by
``taxa-with-api``. The benchmark side counts accepted species-rank GBIF rows
into the same broad groups so publication attention can be compared against
described diversity.

The driver-conditional attention estimator that once lived here moved to a
``driver_conditional`` module, which was itself retired on 2026-08-02 along with
the whole driver x taxon lens; see
``notebooks/results/archive/retired-helpers/2026-08-02-f4-driver-lens/``.
